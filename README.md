## MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
Android Application built using MVP + Retrofit to shown several movies from "The Movie DB" platform.

The MVP stands for Model View Presenter. In this architecture, each layer is defined to do certain tasks.

+ `Model` is responsible for handling all business logic, communication with backend server and database operations.
+ `The View` is responsible for displaying data to a user in the form of UI screens. In Android usually, Activity implements the View.
+ `The Presenter` is acted as a middleman between View and Model. It basically retrieves data from Model and returns it to View for display Purpose.

## Project Overview

For this project, we will use TMDB API. The internet movie database is a web page similar to IMDB where you can find a list of movies with their description, images, trailers and so on. We are going to show the list of popular movies in recycle view and also details of the selected movie. 

Here is the final project we are about to build.
